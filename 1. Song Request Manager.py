Week 3 Session 1 - Intro to Lists Pt 1
Goal: Create a program that manages song requests for a DJ.
The program should:
Print instructions at the beginning.
Continuously ask the user to enter a song title.
Exit the program if the user types ‚ÄúQuit.‚Äù
If the song title was previously requested, notify the user and share
the song position.
Otherwise, add the song to the request list, notify the user and share
the song position.
Challenge: Remove a song the user wants removed.
