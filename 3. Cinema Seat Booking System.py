"""
Goal: Using a 2D list, create a booking system for a movie theatre
consists of 40 seats, organized in 5 rows of 8 seats. If a seat is
booked, its correspond cell in the 2D list has a value of 1. If empty,
it has a value of 0.
The system should have a menu system with the following options:

Option 1Ô∏è‚É£: Book a seat by row / column
Option 2Ô∏è‚É£: Book multiple seats in a given row
Option 3Ô∏è‚É£: Book seat in back row
Option 4Ô∏è‚É£: Exit
